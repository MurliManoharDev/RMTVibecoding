## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with enhanced schema:

### Requests Table
- `id` - Text primary key (R001, R002, etc.)
- `type` - Request type (Add, Transfer, Terminate)
- `company` - Company name
- `status` - Current status (Pending, PMO Review, Approved, etc.)
- `user_name` - Employee name
- `start_date` - Start/effective date
- `location` - Employee location
- `racf_id` - RACF identifier
- `details` - JSON details
- `form_data` - Complete form data as JSON
- `created_date` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_date` - Last update timestamp

### Users Table (for future expansion)
- `id` - Primary key
- `username` - Unique username
- `email` - User email
- `role` - User role (admin, manager, user)
- `created_date` - Creation timestamp

## API Endpoints

### Request Management
- `GET /api/requests` - Get all requests
- `GET /api/requests/<type>` - Get requests by type (all, add, transfer, terminate)
- `POST /api/submit-request` - Submit a new request
- `PUT /api/requests/<id>/status` - Update request status

### Web Routes
- `GET /` - Main single-page application
- All other routes return the main page (SPA routing)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: The application runs on port 5001 by default
2. **Database not created**: Ensure write permissions in the project directory
3. **Templates not loading**: Verify the `templates/` folder exists
4. **Static files not loading**: Check that the `static/js/` folder contains `app.js`

### Logs and Debugging
- Enable debug mode in `app.py` (enabled by default in development)
- Check the console output for error messages
- Verify all dependencies are installed correctly

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and authorization
- Email notifications for status changes
- File upload functionality for requests
- Advanced reporting with charts and analytics
- Export functionality (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Admin panel for user and system management
- Mobile app using the existing API
- Integration with external HR systems
