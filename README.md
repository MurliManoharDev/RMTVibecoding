## Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with three main tables:

### Requests Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `type` - Request type (add, transfer, terminate)
- `title` - Request title
- `description` - Detailed description
- `status` - Current status (pending, approved, rejected, completed)
- `priority` - Priority level (low, medium, high)
- `created_by` - User who created the request
- `assigned_to` - User assigned to handle the request
- `created_date` - Creation timestamp
- `updated_date` - Last update timestamp
- `comments` - Additional comments

### Users Table (for future expansion)
- `id` - Primary key
- `username` - Unique username
- `email` - User email
- `role` - User role (admin, manager, user)
- `created_date` - Creation timestamp

### Audit Log Table
- `id` - Primary key
- `request_id` - Foreign key to requests
- `action` - Action performed
- `performed_by` - User who performed the action
- `timestamp` - Action timestamp
- `details` - Action details

## Usage Guide

### Creating Requests
1. Click on the appropriate request type button from the dashboard
2. Fill in the required information:
   - Title (required)
   - Description (required)
   - Priority level
   - Your name
3. Click "Submit Request"

### Viewing Requests
- **View All Requests**: See complete list with search and filter options
- **View by Type**: See specific request types (Add, Transfer, Terminate)
- **View by Status**: Organize requests by their current status

### Managing Requests
- Use the dropdown in the Actions column to change request status
- Search requests using the search bar
- Filter by status using the status dropdown
- Click on request details for more information

### Reports
- Access basic analytics from the Reports page
- View request statistics and trends
- Generate custom reports (feature planned for future updates)

## API Endpoints

### Request Management
- `POST /api/submit-request` - Submit a new request
- `PUT /api/requests/{id}/update-status` - Update request status

### Web Routes
- `GET /` - Dashboard
- `GET /add-request` - Add request form
- `GET /transfer-request` - Transfer request form
- `GET /terminate-request` - Terminate request form
- `GET /view-all-requests` - View all requests
- `GET /view-add-requests` - View add requests
- `GET /view-transfer-requests` - View transfer requests
- `GET /view-terminate-requests` - View terminate requests
- `GET /view-by-status` - View by status
- `GET /reports` - Reports page

## Customization

### Styling
- Edit `static/css/styles.css` to modify the appearance
- The design uses CSS custom properties for easy theme customization
- Responsive breakpoints are defined for mobile compatibility

### Functionality
- Add new request types by modifying the database schema and forms
- Extend the API by adding new routes in `app.py`
- Add new pages by creating templates and routes

### Database
- The SQLite database is automatically created on first run
- Add new fields by modifying the `init_database()` function
- Create database migrations for production deployments

## Future Enhancements

The application is designed to be easily expandable. Planned features include:

- User authentication and authorization
- Email notifications for status changes
- File attachments for requests
- Advanced reporting with charts
- Export functionality (PDF, Excel, CSV)
- Admin panel for user management
- API documentation with Swagger
- Docker containerization
- Database backup and restore

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Change the port in `app.py`:
   ```python
   app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0', port=5001)  # Use different port
   ```

2. **Database not created**: Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory

3. **Templates not loading**: Verify the `templates/` folder exists with all HTML files

4. **Static files not loading**: Check that the `static/` folder contains `css/` and `js/` subdirectories

### Logs and Debugging
- Enable debug mode in `app.py` (already enabled by default)
- Check the console output for error messages
- Verify all dependencies are installed correctly

## Production Deployment

### Environment Setup
1. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your-production-secret-key"
   export FLASK_ENV="production"
   export DEBUG="False"
   ```

2. **Use a production WSGI server**:
   ```bash
   pip install gunicorn
   gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
   ```

3. **Database backup**:
   ```bash
   # Regular backup of SQLite database
   cp rmt_database.db rmt_database_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).db
   ```

### Security Considerations
- Change the default secret key
- Use HTTPS in production
- Implement user authentication (planned feature)
- Regular database backups
- Monitor application logs
